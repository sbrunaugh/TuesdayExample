Here are all the git commands we learned today:

git init -> initialize a new git repo.

git checkout -b "<branch-name>" -> creates a new branch and switches to it.

git add <file name> -> tracks the changes in a file.

git commit -m "<message>" -> commits changes to a local branch.

git push -> pushes local branch up to "origin".

// Guidelines
1. Don't work on master branch. Use your own branch.
